## XPlus Autofish

Autofish is a update of [MrTroot's Autofish mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autofish) to 1.20.1. With a GUI checker so the mod turns off while a GUI is popped up, added by XPlus.

In short, just cast the fishing rod into the water once, and it will automatically reel in at the correct time and recast after a couple second wait. You can open the config screen of the mod via hotkey (V by default).
